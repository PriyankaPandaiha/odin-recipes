        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>400 grams onion</li>
            <li>3 chilli</li>
            <li>Few curry leaves</li>
            <li>2 tbsp coriander</li>
            <li>1 tsp chilli powder</li>
            <li>¼ tsp turmeric</li>
            <li>¼ tsp cumin powder</li>
            <li>1 tsp ginger paste</li>
            <li>¾ tsp salt</li>
            <li>1½ cup besan / gram flour</li>
            <li>¼ cup rice flour</li>
            <li>Oil</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>STEPS</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Firstly, thinly slice the onions. Make sure to slice in uniform thickness as it helps to fry easily.</li>
            <li>Transfer the sliced onion into a large bowl. Now add 3 chilli, few curry leaves, 2 tbsp coriander, 1 tsp chilli powder, ¼ tsp turmeric, ¼ tsp cumin powder, 1 tsp ginger paste and ¾ tsp salt.</li>
            <li>Squeeze and mix well making sure all the spices are well combined and onions release moisture.</li>
            <li>Further add 1½ cup besan, ¼ cup rice flour and mix well, squeeze and mix without adding any water, as the water in the onion is enough to form the dough. Add more besan if required.</li>
            <li>Now drop the dough into hot oil forming a random shape.</li>
            <li>Fry on medium flame stirring occasionally, fry until the pakoda turns golden brown and crisp.</li>
            <li>Finally, drain off the pakoda and enjoy with hot tea.</li>
        </ol>
